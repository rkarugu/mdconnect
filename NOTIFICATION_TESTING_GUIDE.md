# Medical Worker Notification System - Testing Guide

## ✅ System Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The notification system is complete and working end-to-end. Here's how to test it:

## 🔧 How to Test Notifications

### 1. Create a Test Shift (Triggers Notifications)

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/facility/shifts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FACILITY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Shift - General Medicine",
    "description": "Test shift to verify notifications",
    "shift_date": "2024-08-01",
    "start_time": "09:00",
    "end_time": "17:00",
    "location": "Test Hospital",
    "worker_type": "Doctor",
    "slots_available": 2,
    "pay_rate": 75.00,
    "auto_match": true
  }'
```

**Via Web Interface:**
1. Login as a medical facility
2. Go to "Post Shift" or "Create Shift"
3. Fill in shift details
4. Submit the form

### 2. Verify Notifications Were Created

**Check Database:**
```sql
SELECT id, notifiable_id, type, data, created_at 
FROM notifications 
WHERE type = 'App\\Notifications\\NewShiftAvailable' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/worker/notifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WORKER_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Test Frontend Integration

**Flutter App:**
1. Login as a medical worker
2. Navigate to notifications screen
3. You should see notifications like:
   - "New Shift Available"
   - "A new Doctor shift is available at [Facility Name]"

## 📱 Expected Notification Format

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-here",
  "type": "App\\Notifications\\NewShiftAvailable",
  "data": {
    "title": "New Shift Available",
    "message": "A new Doctor shift is available at Test Medical Facility",
    "shift_id": 1,
    "facility_name": "Test Medical Facility",
    "specialty": "Doctor",
    "start_date": "2024-08-01",
    "rate_per_hour": 75.00
  },
  "read_at": null,
  "created_at": "2024-07-31 18:45:00"
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No Notifications Received?

1. **Check Medical Workers:**
   - Ensure medical workers exist with matching specialty
   - Verify `medical_specialty_id` is set correctly
   - Check worker status is "approved"

2. **Check Specialties:**
   - Ensure `medical_specialties` table has matching entries
   - Verify specialty names match `worker_type` values

3. **Check Database:**
   - Verify `notifications` table exists
   - Check for any error logs in `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Check notifications
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'Notifications: ' . \DB::table('notifications')->count();"

# Check medical workers
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'Workers: ' . \App\Models\MedicalWorker::count();"

# Check specialties
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'Specialties: ' . \App\Models\MedicalSpecialty::count();"
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Notifications appear in database
- [ ] API returns notifications for authenticated worker
- [ ] Flutter app displays notifications
- [ ] Mark as read functionality works
- [ ] Unread count updates correctly
